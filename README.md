## Source code

We only support the precompiled version for Win32 Program, If you need them, check releases page.

I built them under:

- Windows 8.1 Pro + VS 2017(v141)
- Other dependencies the program required 
- WinSDK 10.0.17143.0

For Linux, You could download from their original repo and compile it using gcc inside your kali.

Note: Software written in Golang compiled statically by default.

## Onekeyxxxxxx

`ln -s` them to `/usr/local/bin` and `chmod +x`.
